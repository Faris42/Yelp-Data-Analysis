# Yelp-Data-Analysis
Jupyter Notebook Summarizing the Data Analysis Project on Yelp Restaraunts

Due to the pandemic, consumers are increasingly relying on online reviews to assess the quality of business offerings (i.e. there is less in-person trials). People are relying more on the information they collect from the internet. Ratings can affect the number of visitors to a particular business and thus the revenue it earns. Through our project we provide a deeper examination into Yelp's five start rating to better understand how the choice of words in reviews and a business's location can impact the rating it receives on the platform.

In our analysis we asked two questions:
1) How do ratings of restaurants influence positive/ negative word choice?
2) What's the distribution of ratings based on urban vs rural locations in the U.S?

We found that for the first research question, people tend to use positive words more in 3, 4, and 5 star reviews than in 1 and 2 star reviews. We also found that people tend to use negative words regardless of the review type. For the second research question, we found that there was no significant difference between urban and rural locations in terms of review stars.
